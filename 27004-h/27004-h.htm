<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>EXTINCT VOLCANOS AND MOUNTAINS OF GOLD IN
SCOTLAND.</h3>

  <p>It is by some supposed that the Hill of Noth, in the parish of Rhynie,
  Aberdeenshire, had at one time been a volcano in full operation: others,
  again, maintain that the scoria found on and in the neighbourhood are
  portions of a vitrified fort, which had at one time stood on its summit.
  I am not aware that the matter has been investigated since our
  advancement in the science of geology has enabled us to have a more
  intimate knowledge of these things than formerly. The last statistical
  account of Scotland has suffered severely in its Aberdeenshire volume, in
  consequence of the temporary deposition of the "seven Strathbogie
  clergymen." The accounts of their several parishes were written by
  parties only newly come to reside in them, and who appear to have taken
  little interest in it; and Rhynie is one of these. Those who argue for
  its having been a volcano, say that it is very possible that there may at
  one time have been an electric or magnetic chain connecting it with
  subterranean fire in some other quarter of the world; and that by some
  convulsion of nature, the spinal cord of its existence had been broken,
  and life became extinct. This hypothesis has been acted on, in accounting
  for the earthquakes which occur at Comrie in Perthshire. The great storm
  which devastated the princely estates of Earl Goodwin in Kent (circa anno
  1098), and now so well known to mariners as the Goodwin Sands, is also
  said to have laid waste the parish of Forvie, in Aberdeenshire. On the
  occasion of the great earthquake at Lisbon in 1755, a flock of sheep were
  drowned in their cot in the neighbourhood of Lossiemouth, near Elgin, by
  the overflowing of the tide, although far removed from ordinary
  high-water-mark. Assuming this mountain to have been a volcano, are there
  any others in Great Britain? While on the subject of mountains in that
  quarter, there is another which also demands attention for quite a
  different reason, the Hill of Dun-o-Deer, in the parish of Insch: a
  conical hill of no great elevation, on the top of which stand the remains
  of a vitrified fort <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>or castle, said to have been built by King
  Gregory about the year 880, and was used by that monarch as a
  hunting-seat and where, combining business with pleasure, he is said to
  have meted out even-handed justice to his subjects in the Garioch. It has
  long been the popular belief that this hill contains gold; and that the
  teeth of sheep fed on it assume a yellower tinge, and also that their fat
  is of the same colour. Notwithstanding this, no attempt at scientific
  investigation has ever been made. The operations on the line of the Great
  North of Scotland Railway, now in progress in the immediate
  neighbourhood, may possibly bring something to light. This line passes
  for many miles through a country particularly rich in recollections of
  the "olden time"&mdash;cairns, camps, old chapels, druidical circles,
  sculptured stones, &amp;c. and where ancient coins, battle-axes of all
  the three periods, urns and elf-arrow heads, Roman armour, &amp;c., have
  been disinterred by the ordinary labours of the field. Within a short
  distance of its route lies the Hill of Barra, where the famous battle was
  fought, anno 1308, between the "Bruce" and the "Comyn;" the Bass at
  Inverary, the Hill of Benachie, with the remains of a fortification on
  its summit, said to have been erected by the Picts; the field of Harlaw,
  famed in song, where the battle was fought in 1411, in which Donald of
  the Isles was defeated. There are many traditional ballads and stories
  relating to Benachie and Noth. There is a ballad called "John O'Benachie"
  and another, "John O'Rhynie, or Jock O'Noth" and they do not appear in
  any collection of ancient ballads I have seen. It is said that long
  "before King Robert rang," two giants inhabited these mountains, and are
  supposed to be the respective heroes of the two ballads. These two sons
  of Anak appear to have lived on pretty friendly terms, and to have
  enjoyed a social crack together, each at his own residence, although
  distant some ten or twelve miles. These worthies had another amusement,
  that of throwing stones at each other; not small pebbles you may believe,
  but large boulders. On one occasion, however, there appears to have been
  a coolness between them; for one morning, as he of Noth was returning
  from a foraging excursion in the district of Buchan, his friend of
  Benachie, not relishing what he considered an intrusion on his legitimate
  beat, took up a large stone and threw at him as he was passing. Noth, on
  hearing it rebounding, coolly turned round, and putting himself in a
  posture of defence, received the ponderous mass on the sole of his foot:
  and I believe that the stone, with a deeply indented foot-mark on it, is,
  like the bricks in Jack Cade's chimney, "alive at this day to testify."
  Legendary lore and fabulous ballads aside, it would indeed be strange if
  something interesting to the antiquary does not turn up in such a mine as
  this. It is curious, however, that in all the operations antecedent to
  covering Great Britain with, as it were, a network of iron, so very few
  discoveries should have been made of any importance, either to the
  antiquary or geologist.</p>

<h3>THOMAS BLOUNT, AUTHOR OF "FRAGMENTA ANTIQUITATIS," ETC.</h3>

  <p>Being on a visit to some friends on the confines of the county of
  Salop, bordering on Herefordshire, I took the opportunity long cherished
  of visiting the spot where lie the remains of the author of <i>Boscobel;
  Fragmenta Antiquitatis, or Ancient Tenures of Land, and Jocular Customs
  of Manors, &amp;c.</i>, and copied the following inscription from his
  monument, in the chancel of the ancient church of Orleton in the latter
  county. I believe it has never been published; and although neither Note
  nor Query is connected with it, it may serve to fill up a corner in your
  valuable miscellany, and thus preserve from the oblivion of a retired
  country church, a memorial of one well known to the antiquarian world of
  literature. It is on a brass plate inserted in a stone monument against
  the wall of the chancel:</p>

  <p>The village of Orleton is celebrated for a very large annual fair,
  which occurs on April 23; and a saying is connected therewith: "That the
  cuckoo always comes on Orleton fair-day;" which has doubtless arisen from
  the circumstance, that this "messenger of spring" generally arrives in
  this country by that day.</p>

<h3>"GIVE HIM A ROLL."&mdash;A PLEA FOR THE HORSE.</h3>

  <p>We learn, from the comedy of the <i>The Clouds</i>, that the Athenians
  were accustomed to refresh their horses after a race by allowing then to
  roll on the ground; for Pheidippides, the wild young man of the play, who
  spent much of his own time and of his father's money on the "turf," and
  who is shown in the opening scene fast asleep in bed, dreaming of his
  favourite amusement, says very quietly,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I have often seen racing, I have often seen hunters brought home after
  a hard day's work, and I have read of forced marches, &amp;c. made by
  cavalry and artillery; but never yet have I heard of an English
  Houyhnhnm, either at home or abroad, who was invited to refresh himself
  after his labours, civil or military, classically, with a
  <i>roll</i>.</p>

  <p>Dobbin, that four-footed Ofellus,</p>

  <p>whenever he has the luck to spend his summer Sunday's <i>otium cum
  dignitate</i> in a paddock, invariably indulges in a baker's dozen,
  without waiting for an invitation to do so, and without saying "with your
  leave" or "by your leave."</p>

  <p>They ordered this matter better in Africa some fifty years ago, and I
  hope they still continue so to order it.</p>

  <p>By one of the stipulations of the hollow Peace of Amiens, the colony
  of the Cape of Good Hope was restored by Great Britain to the Batavian
  Republic, which immediately appointed Mr. J.&nbsp;A. de Mist its
  Commissary-General, and despatched him to receive the ceded territory
  from the hands of the English, to instal the new Governor, General J.&nbsp;W.
  Janssens, into his high office, and to reorganise the constitution of the
  colony.</p>

  <p>Having fulfilled these duties, Mr. De Mist determined to make a tour
  of inspection, and he accordingly travelled <i>on horseback</i> nearly
  4500 English miles through the interior. Among his suite was a Dr.
  Lichtenstein, the physician and <i>savant</i> of the party, who
  afterwards published an account of the expedition.</p>

  <p>The extract that I am about to make from his work may at first sight
  appear unnecessarily long; but I wish the "courteous reader" to bear in
  mind that I do not cite it for the sake of parading a long rambling
  comment on five short words of Aristophanes, but for that of bringing
  forward additional evidence, to prove that a dry roll may occasionally be
  of as much service in recruiting the strength and spirits of that noble
  animal, the horse, when jaded by violent exertion or long-protracted
  toil, as our English nostrums, a warm mash or a bottle of water. Dr.
  Lichtenstein says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our road led us soon again over the Vogel river and here we were
  obliged to supply ourselves with water for the whole day, since not a
  drop was to be met with again till the Melk river, a distance of ten
  hours [ = 50 English miles]. When we had filled our vessels, and our
  cattle had drunk plentifully, we proceeded on our way.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult for an European to form an idea of the hardships that
  are to be encountered in a journey over such a dry plain at the hottest
  season of the year. All vegetation seems utterly destroyed; not a blade
  of grass, not a green leaf, is anywhere to be seen; and the soil, a stiff
  loam, reflects back the heat of the sun with redoubled force; a man may
  congratulate himself that, being on horseback, he is raised some feet
  above it. Nor is any rest from these fatigues to be thought of, since to
  stop where there is neither shade, water, or grass, would be only to
  increase the evil, rather than to diminish it.</p>

  <p>"Yet the African horses are so well accustomed to hardships, although
  they have in fact much less innate strength than the European, that it is
  incredible what a length of way they will go, in the most intense heat,
  without either food or drink. It is, however, customary for the riders to
  dismount at intervals, when the saddles are taken off, and the animals
  are suffered to roll upon the ground and stretch out their limbs for a
  short time. This they do with evident delight, and after they have well
  rolled, stretched, and shaken themselves, they rise up and go on as much
  refreshed as if they had had food and drink given them. On arriving at a
  farm, the invitation of the host, who comes immediately to the door, is,
  'Get off, Sir, and let him roll.' A slave then appears, takes the horse,
  and leads him backwards and forwards for a few minutes, to recover his
  breath, and he is then unsaddled and left to roll.</p>

  <p>"These rollings were then the only refreshment we could offer our
  horses, and both they and their riders were, when towards evening they
  arrived at the Melk river, exceedingly exhausted."&mdash;<i>Travels in
  Southern Africa in the Years 1803-1806</i>. By Henry Lichtenstein, Doctor

<h3>DREAM TESTIMONY.</h3>

  <p>On Saturday the 30th of July, 1853, the dead body of a young woman was
  discovered in a field at Littleport, in the Isle of Ely. The body has not
  yet been identified, and there can be little doubt that the young woman
  was murdered. At the adjourned inquest, held on the 29th of August,
  before Mr. William Marshall, one of the coroners for the isle, the
  following extraordinary evidence was given:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"James Jessop, an elderly, respectable-looking labourer, with a face
  of the most perfect stolidity, and <!-- Page 288 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>{288}</span>who possessed a most
  curiously-shaped skull, broad and flat at the top, and projecting greatly
  on each side over the ears, deposed: 'I live about a furlong and a half
  from where the body was found. I have seen the body of the deceased. I
  had never seen her before her death. On the night of Friday, the 29th of
  July, I dreamt three successive times that I heard the cry of murder
  issuing from near the bottom of a close called Little Ditchment Close
  (the place where the body was found). The first time I dreamt I heard the
  cry it woke me. I fell asleep again, and dreamt the same again. I then
  woke again, and told my wife. I could not rest; but I dreamt it again
  after that. I got up between four and five o'clock, but I did not go down
  to the close, the wheat and barley in which have since been cut. I dreamt
  once, about twenty years ago, that I saw a woman hanging in a barn, and
  on passing the next morning the barn which appeared to me in my dream I
  entered, and did find a woman there hanging, and cut her down just in
  time to save her life. I never told my wife I heard any cries of murder,
  but I have mentioned it to several persons since. I saw the body on the
  Saturday it was found. I did not mention my dream to any one till a day
  or two after that. I saw the field distinctly in my dream and the trees
  thereon, but I saw no person in it. On the night of the murder the wind
  lay from that spot to my house.'</p>

  <p>"Rhoda Jessop, wife of the last witness, stated that her husband
  related his dreams to her on the evening of the day the body was
  found."</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>"Priam's six-gated city," &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In the prologue to
  Troilus and Cressida occurs&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp;Priam's six-gated city,</p>
      <p>Dardan and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Trojan,</p>
      <p>And Antenorides, with massy staples,</p>
      <p>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What struck me here was the omission of the only gate of Troy really
  known to fame, <i>the Scæan</i>, which looked on the tomb of the founder
  Laomedon; before which stood Hector, "full and fixed," awaiting the fatal
  onslaught of Achilles; where Achilles, in turn, received his death-wound
  from the shaft of Paris; and through which, finally, the wooden horse was
  triumphantly conveyed into the doomed city.</p>

  <p>The six names are shown to be taken by Shakspeare in part from Caxton,
  and in part from Lydgate: and in Knight's edition we are told that they
  are "pure inventions of the middle age of romance-writers."</p>

  <p>Let us examine this assertion. The names are to be found pretty nearly
  as above, but with one important difference, in Dares' <i>History of the
  Trojan War</i>. My authority is Ruæus, the Delphine editor of Virgil (see
  his note at <i>Æn.</i> <span class="scac">II.</span> 612.). Now Dares
  (perhaps the oldest of the profane writers whom we know) was a Phrygian,
  who took part in the Trojan war, and wrote its history in Greek: and the
  Greek original was still extant in the time of Ælian, from <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 80 to 140. Of this, now lost, a Latin
  translation still survives, by some attributed to Cornelius Nepos, and by
  some regarded as spurious; but, either way, its date must be long
  antecedent to "the middle age of romance-writers." It was doubtless from
  this Latin history that Caxton or Lydgate, or both, derived directly or
  indirectly the names they adopted; and yet it is to be noted that they
  give respectively the names of <i>Chetas</i> and <i>Cetheas</i> to one of
  their gates, and omit the well-known <i>Scæan</i>, which Dares expressly
  mentions; for I presume that no principle of philology will sanction the
  identification of <i>Scæan</i> with either of the terms used by these two
  writers.</p>

  <p>I have trespassed somewhat on your space, but let me hope the subject
  may be farther elucidated. The points I wish to put forward are,
  Shakspeare's omission of the Scæan gate, and the proposition by Knight
  (for a proposition it is, though in a participular form), that these six
  names are "pure inventions of the middle age of romance-writers."</p>

  <p><i>On the Word "delighted" in "Measure for Measure," &amp;c.</i> (Vol.
  viii., p. 241.).&mdash;Inasmuch as the controversy respecting this word
  seems to be over, and no one of the critics and commentators on
  Shakspeare's text appears to have the slightest clue to the real meaning
  and derivation, I will enlighten them. But, first, I must say, I am
  surprised that <span class="sc">Dr. Kennedy</span> should (though he has
  certainly hit on the right meaning) be unable to give a better account of
  the word than that in Vol. ii., pp. 139. 250. And as to the passage
  quoted (Vol. ii., p. 200) by <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> from
  Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, I beg to inform him that the word
  <i>delight</i>, which occurs therein, is a misprint for
  <i>daylight</i>!</p>

  <p>We find, in the Latin, the substantive <i>deliciæ</i>, delight,
  pleasure, enjoyment; and the adjective (derived from the same root, and
  <i>guiding us to the original meaning of the substantive</i>)
  <i>delicatus</i>, which amongst other meanings, has that of tender, soft,
  gentle, delicate, dainty.</p>

  <p>As the early English scholars were not very particular about the
  <i>form</i> of the words they introduced from the Latin, or indeed of
  those which were purely English, for they changed them at their
  pleasure,&mdash;and that this is the case, I presume no one at all versed
  in the literature of the time of Henry VIII. will dispute,&mdash;it
  requires no great exertion of fancy to believe, that, finding <!-- Page
  289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>{289}</span>the
  substantive <i>deliciæ</i> Englished <i>delight</i>, they rendered the
  adjective <i>delicatus</i> delighted. The <i>fact</i> that they
  <i>did</i> use the words <i>delight</i> and <i>delicate</i> as
  synonymous, is proved by a passage in "a boke named the <i>Gouernour</i>
  deuised by Syr Thomas Elyot, Knyght, Londini, 1557;" in which, at folio
  203., p. 1., we find Titus, the son of Vespasian, who was ordinarily
  termed "the delight of mankind," called "the delicate of the world."</p>

  <p>We are therefore to conclude that the words <i>delicate</i> and
  <i>delighted</i> were used indifferently by writers of the age of
  Shakspeare, as well as by those previous to him, to express the same
  thing; and that by the phrase "delighted spirit" in <i>Measure for
  Measure</i>, "delighted beauty" in <i>Othello</i>, "delighted gifts" in
  <i>Cymbeline</i>, we are to understand, exquisitely tender, delicate, or
  precious.</p>

  <p>I cannot agree with <span class="sc">Dr. Kennedy</span> that
  <i>deliciæ</i>, <i>delicatus</i> come from <i>deligere</i> rather than
  <i>delicere</i>; since, if my memory does not deceive me, the former is
  as often, if not oftener, used by good writers to express to drive away,
  to upset, to remove from, or detach&mdash;as to select or
  choose&mdash;which is the only meaning the word has akin to
  <i>deliciæ</i>; whereas <i>delicere</i> is actually used by one of the
  earlier Latin poets for to delight.</p>

  <p>The word <i>dainty</i>, I may inform <span class="sc">Dr.
  Kennedy</span>, is from the obsolete French <i>dein</i> or <i>dain</i>,
  delicate; which probably came from the still older Teut. <i>deinin</i>,
  <i>minuta</i> (vid. Schilter).</p>

  person than the grave divine Alexander Nowell, dean of St. Paul's, author
  of the Catechism, whose fondness for angling is also commemorated by
  Izaak Walton. Fuller, having noticed the narrow escape which Nowell had
  from arrest by some of Bishop Bonner's emissaries in Queen Mary's reign,
  having had a hint to fly whilst fishing in the Thames, "whilst Nowell was
  catching of fishes, Bonner was catching of Nowell," proceeds to

<h3>EARL OF LEICESTER'S PORTRAIT, 1585.</h3>

  <p>There is at Penshurst, among many other interesting memorials of the
  Dudleys, an original portrait of Elizabeth's Earl of Leicester, with the
  following painted upon it: "Robert, E. of Leicester, Stadtholder of
  Holland, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1585." After this comes the
  ragged staff, but without its usual accompaniment, the bear. Under the
  staff follow these enigmatical lines, which I request any of your
  correspondents to translate and explain. I send you a translation in
  rhyme; I should thank them the more if they would do the same: as to
  explanation, the longer the better.</p>

  presented to Leicester; if so, there would have been a <i>jussu

  but no such compliment was to be expected from the Dutch, for they hated
  him, complained of his conduct, memorialised the queen against him: see
  the pamphlets in the British Museum, 4to. 1587, C. 32. a. 2. But though
  it was most unlikely that the Dutch or their stadtholder should have
  presented this picture to Leicester, it well accorded with Leicester's
  vanity and presumption, and still more with that vanity and presumption
  as displayed in his conduct as commander-in-chief of the forces in
  Holland, to call himself <i>The Stadtholder</i>, and to order his painter
  to put that title under his portrait.</p>

  <p>The verses may now be referred to in support of this view of the
  subject. Leicester therein represents himself as unhappy, because he had
  bestowed blessings on the ungrateful Dutch.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, take the following full-length portrait of Leicester's
  indignation (<i>Leicester, a Belgis vituperatus, loquitur</i>):</p>

<h3>EARLY USE OF TIN.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Layard, in his work upon Nineveh and Babylon, in reference to the
  articles of bronze from Assyria now in the British Museum, states, that
  the <i>tin</i> used in the composition was probably obtained from
  Ph&oelig;nicia; and, consequently, that <i>that</i> used in the Assyrian
  bronze may actually have been <i>exported</i> nearly <i>three
  thousand</i> years ago from the British Isles.</p>

  <p>The Assyrians appear to have made an extensive use of this metal; and
  the degree of perfection which the making of bronze had then reached,
  clearly shows that they must have been long experienced in the use of it.
  <i>They</i> appear to have received what they used from the
  Ph&oelig;nicians. <i>When</i> and <i>by whom</i> was tin first discovered
  in our island? Were the <i>Celtic tribes</i> acquainted with it
  <i>previously</i> to the arrival of the Ph&oelig;nicians upon our
  shores?</p>

  <p>It is said that the Ph&oelig;nicians were indebted to the Tyrian
  Hercules for their trade in tin; and that this island owed them its name
  of <i>Baratanac</i>, or Britain, the land of tin. Was the <i>Tyrian
  Hercules</i>, or, as he was afterwards known and worshipped, as the
  Melkart of Tyre, and the Moloch of the Bible, was <i>he</i> the
  <i>merchant-leader</i> of the first band of Ph&oelig;nicians who visited
  this island? <i>When</i> did <i>he</i> live?</p>

<h3>ST. PATRICK&mdash;MAUNE AND MAN.</h3>

  <p>Amongst the many strange derivations given of the name of Mona or Man
  (the island), I find one in an old unpublished MS. by an unknown author,
  of the date about 1658, noticed by Feltham (<i>Tour through the Isle of
  Man</i>, p. 8.), on which I venture to ground a Query. The name of the
  island is there said to have been derived from Maune, the name of the
  great apostle of the Mann, before he received that of Patricius from Pope
  Celestine.</p>

  <p>Now if St. Patrick ever had the name Maune, he could not have given it
  to the island, which was called Mona, Monabia, and Menavia, as far back
  as the days of Cæsar, Tacitus, and Pliny. I have not access to any life
  of St. Patrick in which the name Maune occurs; but in the <i>Penny
  Cyclopædia</i>, under the head "Patrick," I find it said, "According to
  Nennius, St. Patrick's original name was Maur," and I find the same
  stated in Rose's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>. But the article in the
  latter is evidently taken from the former, and I suspect the Mau<i>r</i>
  may in both be a misprint for Mau<i>n</i>.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Can "N. &amp; Q." set me right, or
  give me any information likely to solve the difficulty?</p>

  <p>I may as well notice here that amongst the many ways in which the name
  of this island has been pronounced and spelt, that of <i>Maun</i> seems
  to have prevailed at the period of the Norwegian occupation. On a Runic
  monument at Kirk Michael, we have it very distinctly so spelt.</p>

  <p>With regard to the name Mona, applied both to Man and Anglesea, I have
  little doubt we may find its root in the Sanscrit <i>man</i>, to know,
  worship, &amp;c., whence we have Manu the son of Brahma, Menu, Menes,
  Minos, Moonshee, and Monk. The name Mona would seem to have been applied
  to both islands, as being specially the habitation of the Druids, whose
  name probably came either from the Celtic <i>Trow-wys</i>, wisemen, or
  the Saxon <i>dru</i>, a soothsayer, very close in signification to the
  Sanscrit <i>mooni</i>, a holy sage, learned person. As connected with
  this idea I may ground another Query: Might not these two Monas, the
  abode of piety and wisdom, be the true, <span title="makarôn nêsoi" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&omega;&nu;
  &nu;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&iota;</span>, the <i>Fortunatæ Insulæ</i> of

<h3>PASSAGE IN BINGHAM.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Richard Bingham</span>, whose new and improved
  edition of his ancestor's works is now printing at the Oxford University
  Press, would feel sincerely obliged to any literary friend who should
  become instrumental in discovering the following passage from one of the
  sermons of Augustine:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Non mirari debetis, fratres carissimi, quod inter ipsa mysteria de
  mysteriis nihil diximus, quod non statim ea, quæ tradidimus, interpretati
  sumus. Adhibuimus enim tam sanctis rebus atque divinis honorem
  silentii."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Joseph Bingham (b. x. ch. v. s. 11.) cites those words as from "Serm.
  I., inter 40. a Sirmondo editos," which corresponds with Serm. V.
  according to the Benedictine edition, Paris, 1689&mdash;1700, tom. v. p.
  28.; but no such words occur in that sermon. The passage is daggered by
  Grishovius, who first gave the citations at length; neither has <span
  class="sc">Mr. R. Bingham</span> hitherto been able to meet with it,
  though a great many similar desiderata in former editions he has
  discovered and corrected.</p>

  <p>An answer through "N. &amp; Q." will oblige; still more so if sent
  direct to his present address, 57. Gloucester Place, Portman Square,
  London.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Bingham</span> would also be glad to be informed
  where Athanasius uses the term <span title="diakonos" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,

  <p><i>Bells at Berwick-upon-Tweed.</i>&mdash;Can any one favour me with a

  the town, and a mean structure of Cromwell's time, is without either
  tower or <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>bell; and the people are summoned to
  divine service from the belfry of the town-hall, which has a very
  respectable steeple. Indeed, so much more ecclesiastical in appearance is
  the town-hall than the Church, that (as I was told) a regiment of
  soldiers, on the first Sunday after their arrival at Berwick, marched to
  the former building for divine service, although the church stood
  opposite the barrack gate. My kind informant also told me that he found a
  strange clergyman one Sunday morning trying the town-hall door, and
  rating the absent sexton; having undertaken to preach a missionary
  sermon, and become involved in the same mistake as the soldiers.</p>

  <p>But more curious still was the news that there is a meeting-house in
  Berwick belonging to the anti-burghers, who are dissenters from the
  Church of Scotland, which has a bell, for the ringing of which, as a
  summons to worship, Barrington, Bishop of Durham, granted a licence,
  which still exists. I was not aware that bishops either had, or
  exercised, the power of licensing bells; but my informant will, I doubt
  not, on reading this, either verify or correct the statement. At the time
  when the bell was licensed, the congregation were in communion with the
  Church of Scotland.</p>

  Possibly some anecdotes may be current regarding it. I learn from a rare
  little tome, entitled <i>Some Account of Kentish Town</i>, published at
  that place in 1821, and written, I believe, by a Mr. Elliot, that the
  Assembly House was formerly called the Black Bull. The writer of this
  Query asked "one of the oldest inhabitants," who was seated on a
  door-step opposite the house, <i>his</i> opinion concerning its age:
  considering a little, the old gentleman seriously said he thought it
  might be two or three <i>thousand</i> years at least! This opinion I am

  <p><i>Peter Lombard.</i>&mdash;Mr. Hallam, in his <i>Literature of

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Peter Lombard, in his <i>Liber Sententiarum</i>, the systematic basis
  of scholastic theology, introduces <i>many</i> Greek words, and explains
  them rightly."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having, however, examined this work for the purpose of ascertaining
  Peter Lombard's knowledge of Greek, I must, out of regard to strict
  truth, deny the statement of Meiners; for only one Greek word in Greek
  letters is to be found in the <i>Liber Sententiarum</i>, and that is
  <span title="metanoia" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1F71;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;</span>: and so far
  frown Peter explaining this word rightly, he says, 'P&oelig;nitentia
  dicitur a puniendo" (lib. <span class="scac">IV</span>. dist. xiv.); an
  etymological notion which caused Luther to think wrongly of the nature of
  repentance, till he learnt the meaning of the Greek word, which he
  received with joy as the solution of one of his greatest difficulties in
  Romanism. I do not consider the introduction of such Latinized church
  words as <i>ecclesia</i>, <i>episcopus</i>, <i>presbyter</i>, or even
  <i>homoöusius</i>, as evincing any knowledge of Greek on the part of
  Peter Lombard, wherein he appears to have been lamentably deficient, as
  the great teacher and authority for centuries in Christian dogmatics.
  Your correspondents will greatly oblige me by showing anything to the
  contrary of my charge against Peter Lombard of being ignorant of
  Greek.</p>

<h3>MILTON AND MALATESTI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 146.; Vol. viii., p. 237.)</p>

  <p>When I gave some account of <i>La Tina</i> of Antonio Malatesti, and
  its dedication to Milton, two years since, I was not aware that it had
  been printed, as I had no other edition of Gamba's <i>Serie dell'
  Edizioni de' Testi di Lingua</i>, than the first printed in 1812. That
  account was derived from the original MS. which formerly passed through
  my hands. I fear that my friend <span class="sc">Mr. Bolton Corney</span>
  will be disappointed if he should meet with a copy of the printed book,
  for the MS. contained no other dedication than the inscription on the
  title-page, of which I made a tracing. It represents an inscribed stone
  tablet, in the following arrangement:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"LA</p>

      <p>Giouanni Milton Nobil'</p>
      <p class="i3">Inghilese."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I copied at the time eight of these equivocal sonnets, and in my
  former notice gave one as a specimen. They are certainly very ingenious,
  and may be "graziosissimi" to an Italian ear and imagination; but I
  cannot think that the pure mind of Milton would take much delight in
  obscene allusions, however neatly wrapped up.</p>

  <p>Milton seems to have dwelt with pleasure on his intercourse with these
  witty, ingenious, and learned men, during his two-months' sojourn at
  Florence; and it is remarkable that Nicolas Heinsius has spoken of the
  same men, in much the same terms, in his dedication to Carlo Dati of the
  second book of his <i>Italici Componimenti</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sanctum mehercules habebo semper Jo. Bapt. Donij memoriam, non tam
  suo nomine (et si hoc quoque) aut quod Frescobaldos, Cavalcantes,
  Gaddios, Cultellinos, alios urbis vestræ viros precipuos mihi
  conciliarit, quorum amicitiam feci hactenus, et faciam porrò maximi, quam
  quod tibi me conjunxerit, mi Date; cujus opera in notitiam, ac
  familiaritatem plurimorum apud vos hominum eximiorum mox irreperem."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, after mentioning others, he adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quid de Valerio Chimentellio, homine omni literatura perpolita,
  dicam? Quid de Joanne Pricæo? qui ingens civitati vestræ ornamentum ex
  ultima nuper accessit Britannia."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One feels some decree of disappointment at not meeting here with the
  name of Milton.</p>

  <p>Of the distinguished men mentioned by Milton, some interesting notices
  occur in that curious little volume, the <i>Bibliotheca Aprosiana</i>.
  Benedetto Buommattei and Carlo Dati are well known from their important
  labours; and of the others there are scattered notices in <i>Rilli
  Notizie degli Uomini Illustre Fiorentine</i>, and in <i>Salvini Fasti
  Consolari dell' Accademia Fiorentina</i>. I have an interesting little
  volume of Latin verses by Jacopo Gaddi, with the following title
  <i>Poetica Jacobi Gaddii Corona e Selectis Poematiis, Notis Allegoriis
  contexta</i>, Bononiæ, 1637, 4to.</p>

  <p>There is a good deal of ingenious and pleasing burlesque poetry extant
  by Antonio Malatesti. I have before mentioned his <i>Sphinx</i>: of this
  I have a dateless edition, apparently printed about the middle of the
  last century at Florence: the title is <i>La Sfinge Enimmi del Signor
  Antonio Malatesti</i>. Commendatory verses are prefixed by Chimentelli,
  Coltellini, and Galileo Galilei. The last, from the celebrity of the
  writer, may deserve the small space it will occupy in your pages. It is
  itself an enigma:</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>{296}</span></p>

  <p>Three more sonnets by this illustrious man are printed by Salvini in
  his <i>Fasti</i>, of which he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I quali esendo parto di si gran mente, mi concederà la gloria il
  benigno lettore, che io, ad honore della Toscana Poesia, gli esponga il
  primo alla publica luce."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Fellowes was not singular in confounding Dati and Deodati; it has
  been done by Fenton and others: but that Dr. Symmons, in his <i>Life of
  Milton</i> (p. 133.), should transform <i>La Tina</i> into a
  <i>wine-press</i>, is ludicrously amusing. <i>La Tina</i> is the rustic
  mistress to whom the sonnets are supposed to be addressed; and every one
  knows that <i>rusticale</i> and <i>contadinesca</i> is that naïve and
  pleasing rustic style in which the Florentine poets delighted, from the
  expressive nature of the patois of the Tuscan peasantry; and it might
  have been said of Malatesti's sonnets, as of another rustic poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ipsa Venus lætos jam nunc migravit in agros</p>
      <p class="i1">Verbaque Aratoris Rustica discit Amor."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I may just remark that the <i>Clementillo</i> of Milton should not be
  rendered <i>Clementini</i>, but <i>Chimentelli</i>. As Rolli tells
  us,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<h3>ATTAINMENT OF MAJORITY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 198. 250.)</p>

  <p>I greatly regret that there should be anything in the matter or manner
  of my Query on this subject to induce <span class="sc">Mr. De
  Morgan</span> to reply to it more as if repelling an offence, than
  assisting in the investigation of an interesting question on a subject
  with which he is supposed to be especially conversant. I can assure him
  that I had no other object in writing <i>ninth</i> numerically instead of
  literally, or in omitting the words he has restored in brackets, or in
  italicising two words to which I wished my question more particularly to
  refer, than that of economising space and avoiding needless repetition;
  and in the use of the word "usage" rather than "law," of which he also
  complains, I was perhaps unduly influenced by the title of his own
  treatise, from which I was quoting. But however I may have erred from
  exact quotation, it is manifest I did not misunderstand the sense of the
  passage, since <span class="sc">Mr. De Morgan</span> now repeats its
  substance in these words,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I cannot make out that the law ever recognised a day of twenty-four
  hours, beginning at any hour except midnight."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is clearly at direct issue with Ben Jonson, whose introduced
  phrases, "pleaded nonage," "wardship," "pupillage," &amp;c., seem to
  smack too much of legal technology to countenance the supposition of
  poetic license.</p>

  <p>But had I not accidentally met with an interesting confirmation of Ben
  Jonson's law of usage, or usage of law, I should not have put forth my
  Query at all, nor presumed to address it to <span class="sc">Professor De
  Morgan</span>; my principal reason for so doing being that the interest
  attaching to discovered evidence of a forgotten usage in legal reckoning,
  must of course be increased tenfold if it should appear to have been
  unknown to a gentleman of such deep and acknowledged research into that
  and kindred subjects.</p>

  <p>In a black-letter octavo entitled <i>A Concordancie of Yeares</i>,
  published in and for the year 1615, and therefore about the very time
  when Ben Jonson was writing, I find the following in chap. xiii.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The day is of two sorts, natural and artificiall: the natural day is
  the space of 24 hours, in which time the sunne is carried by the first
  Mover, from the east into the west, and so round about the world into the
  east againe."</p>

  <p>"The artificiall day continues from sunne-rising to sunne-setting: and
  the artificiall night is from the sunne's setting to his rising. And you
  must note that this natural day, according to divers, hath divers
  beginnings: As the Romanes count it from mid-night to mid-night, because
  at that time our Lorde was borne, being Sunday; and so do we account it
  for fasting dayes. The Arabians begin their day at noone, and end at
  noone the next day; for because they say the sunne was made in the
  meridian; and so do all astronomers account the day, because it alwayes
  falleth at one certaine time. The Umbrians, the Tuscans, the Jewes, the
  Athenians, Italians, and Egyptians, do begin their day at sunne-set, and
  so do we celebrate festivall dayes. The Babylonians, Persians, and
  Bohemians begin their day at sunne-rising, holding till sunne-setting;
  <i>and so do our lawyers count it in England</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here, at least, there can be no supposition of dramatic fiction; the
  book from which I have made this extract was written by Arthur Hopton, a
  distinguished mathematician, a scholar of Oxford, a student in the
  Temple; and the volume itself is dedicated to "The Right Honourable Sir
  Edward Coke, Knight, Lord Chiefe Justice of England," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>JOHN FREWEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 222.)</p>

  <p>He is supposed to have been the son of Richard Frewen, of Earl's Court
  in Worcestershire, and was born either at that place or in its immediate
  vicinity in the early part of the year 1558. Richard Frewen purchased the
  presentation to Northiam rectory, in Sussex, of Viscount Montague, and
  presented John Frewen to it in Nov. 1583; and <!-- Page 297 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>he continued to hold
  that living till his death, which took place at the end of April, 1628.
  He was buried in the chancel of his own church, May 2nd; and a plain
  stone on the floor, with an inscription, marks the place of his
  interment. He was a learned and pious Puritan divine, and wrote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. "Certaine Fruitfull Instructions and necessary Doctrine meete to
  edify in the feare of God." 1587, 18mo.</p>

  <p>2. "Certaine Fruitfull Instructions for the generall Cause of
  Reformation against the Slanders of the Pope and League, &amp;c." 1589,
  small 4to.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3. He edited and wrote the preface to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Courteous Conference with the English Catholickes Romane, about the
  Six Articles administered unto the Seminarie Priestes, wherein it is
  apparently proved by theire own divinitie, and the principles of their

  subjects of their alleageance unto her, &amp;c.; written by John Bishop,

  1621, 12mo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>6. A large unpublished work in MS. entitled "Grounds and Principles of
  Christian Religion," left unfinished (probably age and infirmity
  prevented him from completing it): it consisted of seven books, of which
  two only (the fourth and fifth, of 95 and 98 folio pages respectively)
  have been preserved.</p>

  <p>John Frewen had three wives, and by each of the first two several
  children, of whom the following lived to grow up, viz. by Eleanor his
  first wife, (1.) Accepted Frewen, Archbp. of York; (2.) Thankful F.,
  Purse Bearer and Secretary of Petitions to Lord Keeper Coventry; (3.)
  John F., Rector of Northiam; (4.) Stephen F., Alderman of the Vintry
  Ward, London; (5.) Mary, wife of John Bigg of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; (6.)
  Joseph F. By his second wife, Helen, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Hunt,
  J.&nbsp;F. had (7.) Benjamin, Citizen of London; (8.) Thomas F.; (9.) Samuel,
  Joseph, Thomas, and Samuel joined Cromwell's army for invading Ireland;
  and one of them (Captain Frewen) fell at the storming of Kilkenny;
  another of them died at Limerick of the plague, which carried off General
  Freton; the other (Thomas) founded a family at Castle Connel, near
  Limerick.</p>

  <p>John Frewen's <i>Sermons</i> in 1612 are in some respects rare; but
  the following copies are extant, viz. one in the Bodleian at Oxford; one
  in the University Library at Cambridge; one in possession of Mr. Frewen
  at Brickwall, Northiam; and one sold by Kerslake of Bristol, for
  7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, to the Rev. John Frewen Moor, of Bradfield,

<h3>"VOIDING KNIFE," "VOIDER," AND "ALMS-BASKET."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., pp. 150. 280.; Vol. viii., p. 232.)</p>

  <p>In later times (the sixteenth century) the good old custom of placing
  an <i>alms-dish</i> on the table was discontinued, and with less
  charitable intentions came the less refined custom of removing the broken
  victuals after a meal by means of a <i>voiding-knife</i> and
  <i>voider</i>: the latter was a basket into which were swept by a large
  wand, usually of wood, or <i>voiding-knife</i>, as it was termed, all the
  bones and scraps left upon the trenchers or scattered about the table.
  Thus, in the old plays, <i>Lingua</i>, Act V. Sc. 13.: "Enter Gustus with
  a <i>voiding-knife</i>;" and in <i>A Woman killed with Kindness</i>,
  "Enter three or four serving men, one with a <i>voider</i> and <i>wooden
  knife</i> to take away."</p>

  <p>The voider was still sometimes called the <i>alms-basket</i>, and had
  its charitable uses in great and rich men's houses: one of which was to
  supply those confined in gaols for debt, and such prisoners as had no
  means to purchase any food.</p>

  <p>In Green's <i>Tu Quoque</i>, a spendthrift is cast into prison; the
  jailer says to him:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you have no money, you had best remove into some cheaper ward; to
  the twopenny ward, it is likeliest to hold out with your means; or, if
  you will, you may go into the <i>hole</i>, and there you may feed for
  nothing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To which he replies:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ay, out of the <i>alms-basket</i>, where charity appears in likeness
  of a piece of stinking fish."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even this poor allowance to the distressed prisoners passed through
  several ordeals before it came to them; and the best and most wholesome
  portions were filched from the <i>alms-basket</i>, and sold by the
  jailers at a low price to people out of the prison. In the same play it
  is related of a miser, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He never saw a joint of mutton in his own house these four-and-twenty
  years, but always cozened the poor prisoners, for he brought his victuals
  out of the <i>alms-basket</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the ordinances of Charles II. (<i>Ord. and Reg. Soc. Ant.</i>
  367.), it is commanded&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That no gentleman whatsoever shall send away my meat or wine from the
  table, or out of the chamber, upon any pretence whatsoever; and that the
  gentlemen-ushers take particular care herein, that all the meate that is
  taken off the table upon trencher-plates be put into a basket for the
  poore, and not undecently eaten by any servant in the roome; and if any
  person shall presume to do otherwise, he shall be prohibited <!-- Page
  298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>immediately to remaine in the chamber, or
  to come there again, until further order."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>alms-basket</i> was also called a <i>maund</i>, and those who
  partook of its contents <i>maunders</i>.</p>

<h3>THE LETTER "H" IN HUMBLE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 229.)</p>

  <p>The recent attempt to introduce a mispronunciation of the word
  <i>humble</i> should be resisted by every one who has learned the plain
  and simple rule of grammar, that "<i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a
  vowel or a silent <i>h</i>." That the rule obtained a considerable time
  ago, we have only to look into the Book of Common Prayer to prove, where
  the congregation are exhorted to come "with an humble, lowly, penitent,
  and obedient heart," and I believe it will be admitted that the compilers
  of that work fully understood the right pronunciation.</p>

  <p>It may assist to settle the question by giving the etymology of the
  word <i>humble</i>. It is derived from the Celtic <i>uim</i>, the ground,
  Latin <i>humus</i>. <i>Umal</i> in Celtic is humble, lowly, obedient; and
  the word signifies the bending of the mind or disposition, just as a man
  would kneel or become prostrate before a superior.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Fras. Crossley</span>.</p>

  <p>In the course of a somewhat long life I have resided in the North of
  England, in the West, and in London, upwards of twenty years each, and my
  experience is directly the reverse of that of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dawson</span>. I have very rarely heard the <i>h</i> omitted in
  <i>humble</i>, and when I have heard it, always considered a vulgarity.
  The <i>u</i> at the beginning of a word is always aspirated. I believe
  the only words in which the initial <i>h</i> is not pronounced are
  derived from the Latin. If that were the general rule, which, however, it
  is not, as in <i>habit</i>, <i>herb</i>, &amp;c., still, where <i>h</i>
  precedes <i>u</i>, it would be pronounced according to the universal rule
  for the aspiration of <i>u</i>.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 220.)</p>

  <p>I have great pleasure in removing from the mind of your correspondent
  an erroneous impression which must materially affect his good opinion of
  a school to which I am sincerely attached. He asks if in any of the
  public schools there are libraries of books giving general information
  accessible to the scholars. Now my information only refers to one, that
  of Eton. There is a library at Eton consisting of some thousand volumes,
  filled with books of all kinds, ancient and modern, valuable and
  valueless. It is open to the 150 first in the school on payment of
  eighteen shillings per annum, and on their refusal the option of becoming
  subscribers descends to the next in gradation. The list, however, is
  never full. The money collected goes to the support of a librarian, and
  to buy pens, ink, and paper, and the surplus (necessarily small) to the
  purchase of books. The basis of the library is the set of Delphin
  classics, presented by George I. The late head master (now provost) has
  been a most munificent contributor; Prince Albert has also presented
  several valuable volumes. Whenever the Prince has come to Eton he has
  always visited the library, and taken great interest in its welfare; and
  on his last visit said to the provost that he should be quite ready and
  willing to obey the call whenever he was asked to lay the first stone of
  a museum in connexion with the library.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Etonensis</span>.</p>

  <p>The free grammar school at Macclesfield, Cheshire, has always had a
  library. It <i>did</i> contain some rare volumes of the olden time; it

<h3>DR. JOHN TAYLOR.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. i., p. 466.)</p>

  <p>My attention has been caught by some remarks in the early volumes of
  your work upon my learned ancestor Dr. John Taylor, minister at Norwich,
  and subsequently divinity tutor at Warrington. Whatever opinion may have
  been attributed to Dr. Parr concerning Dr. Taylor, this I know, that on
  revisiting Norwich he desired my father (the Dr.'s grandson) to show him
  the house inhabited by him while he was the minister of the Octagon
  Chapel.</p>

  <p>Dr. Parr looked serious and solemn, and in his usual energetic manner
  pronounced, "He was a <i>great</i> scholar."</p>

  <p>Dr. John Taylor was buried at Kirkstead<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, Lancashire, where his tomb is
  distinguished by the following simple inscription:</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Near to this place lies interr'd<br />

<h3>PORTRAIT OF SIR ANTHONY WINGFIELD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 245.)</p>

  <p>It is most likely that Q., who inquired relative to a picture of Sir
  Anthony Wingfield, may occasionally meet with an engraving of this
  worthy, though the depository of the original portrait is unknown. The
  tale told Horace Walpole by the housekeeper at the house of the Nauntons
  at Letheringham, Suffolk, is not correct. Sir Anthony was a favourite of
  the monarch, and was knighted by him for his brave conduct at Terouenne
  and Tournay. A private plate of Sir Anthony exists, the original portrait
  from which it was taken being at Letheringham at the time the engraving
  was made. The position of the hand in the girdle only indicates the
  fashion of portraiture at the time, and is akin to the frequent custom of
  placing one arm a-kimbo in modern paintings.</p>

  <p>The Query of your correspondent opens a tale of despoliation perhaps
  unparalleled even in the days of iconoclastic fury, and but very
  imperfectly known.</p>

  <p>The estate of Letheringham devolved, about the middle of the last
  century, upon William Leman, Esq., who, being obliged to maintain his
  right against claimants stating they descended from a branch of the
  Naunton family who had migrated into Normandy at the end of the preceding
  century, was placed in a position of considerable difficulty to defend
  his occupation of the house and lands. I will not say by whom, but in
  1770 down came the residence in which the author of the well-known
  <i>Fragmenta Regalia</i> had resided, and, what is far worse, the Priory
  Church, which, after the Dissolution, was made parochial, and which was
  filled with tombs, effigies, and brasses to members of the
  family&mdash;Bovilles, Wingfields, and Nauntons&mdash;was also levelled
  with the ground. It was stated at the time that the sacred edifice had
  only become dilapidated from age, and that the parishioners were
  therefore obliged to do something. What <i>was done</i>, however, was no
  re-edification of the fabric, but its entire destruction, and the
  erection of a new church. Fortunately, Horace Walpole saw the edifice
  before the contractor for the new building had cast his "desiring eyes"
  upon it, and has recorded his impressions in one of his letters. More
  fortunate still, the late Mr. Gough and Mr. Nichols visited it, and the
  former employed the well-known topographical draughtsman, the late James
  Johnson of Woodbridge, Suffolk, to copy some of the effigies, which were
  afterwards engraved and inserted in the second volume of the
  <i>Sepulchral Monuments</i>. The zeal of Johnson, however, led him to
  preserve, by his minute delineation, not only <i>every</i> monument (only
  two, I think, are given by Gough), but also the interior and exterior of
  the church, with the <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>position of the tombs. The interior view
  may be seen among Craven Ord's drawings in the library of the British
  Museum; and I am happy to say I possess Johnson's original sketches of
  all the monuments, and of the exterior of the building. A fair idea of
  the extent of the destruction may be gained by the mention of the fact,
  that six hundred-weight of alabaster effigies were beaten into powder,
  and sold to line water-cisterns. Some of the figures were rescued by the
  late Dr. W. Clubbe, and erected into a pyramid in his garden at
  Brandeston Vicarage, with this inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Fuimus.</i> Indignant Reader, these monumental remains are not (as
  thou mayest suppose) the ruins of Time, but were destroyed in an
  irruption of the Goths so late in the Christian era as the year 1789.
  <i>Credite posteri.</i>"</p>

  <p>William Naunton, son and heir of Thomas Naunton (temp. Hen. VII.), and
  Margery, daughter and heiress of Richard Busiarde, married Elizabeth,
  daughter of Sir Anthony Wingfield. Their only child, Henry Naunton, was
  the father of two sons, viz. Robert the <i>secretary</i> (temp. James
  I.), whose son died unmarried, and daughter, married to Paul Viscount
  Bayning, died without issue; and William Naunton (fil. 2<sup>s</sup>).
  His son and heir, who married a Coke, had one daughter, Theophila,
  married to William Leman (ancestor of the family whose great estates are
  in search of an owner): their only issue, Theophila, married Thomas Rede,
  who thereby became possessed of Letheringham in Suffolk, and the whole of
  the Naunton property. His estates went to his son Robert, who, dying
  without issue in 1822, left them much diminished to his nephew, the Rev.
  Robert Rede Cooper, second son of the Rev. Samuel Lovick Cooper and Sarah
  Leman, youngest daughter, and eventually heiress, of the above Thomas
  Rede. The Rev. Robert Rede Rede (for he assumed that name) died a few
  years ago possessed of Ashmans Park, Suff., which was independent of the
  Naunton property, and of certain heir-looms, the sole remains of the
  great estates of the "Nauntons of Letheringham," which continue in the
  possession of the descendants of that family. It is at <i>Ashmans</i>
  that the portrait inquired for by your correspondent Q. will probably be
  found. Whether that estate has already been sold by the daughters of the
  late possessor (four co-heiresses) I am unable to say.</p>

<h3>BARNACLES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 223.)</p>

  <p>In reference to the article on the barnacle bird in "N. &amp; Q." as
  above, I send you a paper which I lately put in our local journal (<i>The
  Tralee Chronicle</i>), containing a collection of notices of the curious
  errors and <i>gradual</i> correction of them, on the subject of the
  barnacle. I fear it may be long for your columns, but don't know how to
  shorten it; nor can I well omit another amusing notice of the subject, to
  which, since I published it, an intelligent friend called my attention;
  it is from the <i>Memoirs of Lady Fanshaw</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When we came to Calais, we met the Earl of Strafford and Sir Kenelm
  Digby, with some others of our countrymen; we were all feasted at the
  Governor's of the castle, and much excellent discourse passed; but, as
  was reason, most share was Sir Kenelm Digby's, who had enlarged somewhat
  more in extraordinary stories than might be averred, and all of them
  passed with great applause and wonder of the French then at table; but
  the concluding one was&mdash;that barnacles, a bird in Jersey, was first
  a shell-fish to appearance, and from that sticking upon old wood, became
  in time a bird. After some consideration, they unanimously burst out into
  laughter, believing it altogether false, and, to say the truth, it was
  the only thing true he had discoursed with them!&mdash;that was his
  infirmity, tho' otherwise a person of most excellent parts, and a very
  free bred gentleman."&mdash;Lady Fanshaw's <i>Memoirs</i>, pp. 72-3.</p>

  these strange creatures in Vol. i., pp. 117. 169. 254. 340., Vol. viii.,
  pp. 124. 223., may be added an advertisement, extracted from the monthly
  compendium annexed to <i>La Belle Assemblée</i>, or Bell's <i>Court and
  Fashionable Magazine</i>, for June, 1807, in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wonderful natural curiosity, called the Goose Tree, Barnacle Tree, or
  Tree bearing Geese, taken up at sea, on the 12th of January, 1807, by
  Captain Bytheway, and was more than twenty men could raise out of the
  water, which may be seen at the Exhibition Rooms, Spring Gardens, from
  ten o'clock in the morning till ten at night, every day. Admission, one
  shilling; children half-price.</p>

  <p>"The Barnacles which form the present Exhibition, possess a neck
  upwards of two feet in length, resembling the windpipe of a chicken; each
  shell contains five pieces, and notwithstanding the many thousands which
  hang to eight inches of the tree, part of the fowl may be seen from each
  shell. Sir Robert Moxay, in the Wonders of Nature and Art, speaking of
  this singularly curious production, says, in every shell he opened he
  found a perfect sea-fowl, with a bill like that of a goose, feet like
  those of water-fowl, and the feathers all plainly formed.</p>

  <p>"The above wonderful and almost indescribable curiosity, is the only
  exhibition of the kind in the world."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Precision in Photographic Processes.</i>&mdash;I have for a long
  period observed, and been much annoyed at the circumstance, that many of
  your photographic correspondents are very remiss when they favour you
  with recipes for certain processes, in not stating the specific gravity
  of the articles used; also, in giving the quantities, in not stating if
  it is by weight or measure.</p>

  <p>To illustrate my meaning more fully, I will refer to Vol. viii., p.
  252., where a correspondent, in his albumen process, adds "chloride of
  barium, 7¼ dr." Now, as this article is prepared and sold both in
  crystals and in a liquid state, it would be desirable to know which of
  the two is meant before his disciples run the risk of spoiling their
  paper and losing their time.</p>

  <p>How easy would it be to prefix the letter <i>f</i> where fluid oz.,
  dr., or other quantity is meant.</p>

  <p>Trusting that this hint may in future induce your correspondents to be
  as explicit as possible on all points, believe me to be an</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Amateur Photographer</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Tent for Collodion.</i>&mdash;As I have frequently benefited from
  the hints of your correspondents, I in my turn hasten to communicate a
  very simple plan I have contrived for a portable tent for the collodion
  process, in the hope it may be found to answer with others as well as it
  has done with me: it is as follows.</p>

  <p>Round the legs of my camera stand (a tripod one) I have made a
  covering for two of the sides, of a double lining of glazed yellow
  calico, with a few loops at the foot to stake to the ground; the third
  side is made of thick dark cloth, much wider and larger than to cover the
  side, which is fastened at one leg of the stand to the calico. The other
  side is provided with loops to fasten to corresponding buttons on the
  other leg, and by bending on my knees I can easily pull the dark cloth
  over my head and back, fasten the loops to the buttons, and then I can
  perfectly perform any manipulation required, without the risk of any ray
  of white light entering; and certainly nothing can be more
  <i>portable</i>.</p>

  <p>The simplicity of the thing makes any farther description of it
  unnecessary, to say nothing of your valuable space.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jan</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Sisson's Developing Solution.</i>&mdash;The <span
  class="sc">Rev. Mr. Sisson</span>, in a letter I received from him a few
  days ago, stated that he had been trying, at the recommendation of a
  gentleman who had written to him upon the subject, a stronger developing
  solution than that the formula for which he published some time back in
  your pages, and that it gave splendid positive pictures with very short
  exposure in the camera.</p>

  <p>Since I received his letter I have been able to corroborate his
  testimony in favour of the stronger solution, and have much pleasure in
  sending you the formula for the benefit of your readers. It is this: 1½
  drachms of protosulphate of iron in five ounces of water, 1 drachm of
  nitrate of lead, letting it settle for some hours; pour off the clear
  liquid, and then add to it 2 drachms of acetic acid.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Stewart's Pantograph.</i>&mdash;Will some of your photographic
  readers, who may know the proper size of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Stewart's</span> pantograph, give a detailed description of it? We should
  have focal length of lens, size of box, and the length of the sliding,
  parts of it. Cannot the lens be made fast in the middle of the box,
  provided the frames can be adjusted for different-sized pictures?</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>George Browne of Shefford</i> (Vol. viii., p. 243.).&mdash;I
  observe that in your interesting publication you have inserted the Query
  which I sent you long since. A somewhat similar Query of mine has already
  appeared, and been answered by your correspondents H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C. and <span
  class="sc">T. Hughes</span>; the latter stating that my particulars are
  not strictly correct, inasmuch as the individual styled by me as "Sir
  George Browne, <i>Bart.</i>," was in reality simple "George Browne,
  <i>Esq.</i>" I admit this error; but if I was wrong, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Hughes</span> was so too, for George Browne's wife was Eleanor, and
  <i>not</i> Elizabeth, Blount, as appears by his affidavit in the State
  Paper Office, wherein he deposes that he "had by <i>Ellinor</i>, his late
  wife, deceased daughter of Sir Richard Blount, eight sons, namely,
  George, Richard, Anthony, John, William, Henry, Francis, and Robert, and
  seven daughters."</p>

  <p>The sons are thus disposed of:</p>

  <p>1. George, created K. B. at the coronation of Charles II.; married
  Elizabeth Englefield; had issue two daughters; died 1678.</p>

  <p>2. Richard, a captain in the king's army, 1649, and was dead in
  1650.</p>

  <p>3. Anthony, who was "preferred to the trade of a M<i>a</i>rchant,"
  1650.</p>

  <p>4. John, a page to Prince Thomas, uncle to the Duke of Savoy; created
  Bart. 1665; married Mrs. Bradley; had issue.</p>

  <p>5. William, had a "reversion of a copyhold in Shefford."</p>

  <p>6. Henry, died unmarried, 1668; buried at Shefford.</p>

  <p>7. Francis, nine years old in 1651; and</p>

  <p>8. Robert, four years old in 1651.</p>

  <p>In that year (1651) Henry, Francis, and Robert were living with their
  guardian, Mr. <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>Libb, of Hardwick, Oxon; and soon
  afterwards we find them placed under the care of a clergyman at
  Appleshaw. But here we seem to lose sight of them altogether.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> says that the only sons who married
  were George, the heir, and John, the younger brother; but we have no
  evidence of this; and as it is probable that some of the others, namely,
  Richard, Anthony, William, Francis, and Robert, married, I wish to
  procure proof either that they did or did not. If any of these married, I
  wish to know which of them, to whom, and when and where.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of your correspondents can tell me where Richard,
  Anthony, and William resided, and what became of Francis and Robert after
  they had left their tutor, the minister of Appleshaw.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Newburiensis</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Wheale</i> (Vol. vi., p. 579.; Vol. vii., p. 96.).&mdash;Since this
  word is once more brought forward in "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. viii., p. 208.),
  I will answer the Query respecting it. I was prepared to do so shortly
  after it first appeared, but I had reason to expect a reply from one more
  conversant with such archaisms. If the Querist, or either respondent, had
  examined the context, he could not have failed to discover a clue to the
  meaning, as the words "gall of dragons" instead of "wine," and "wheale"
  instead of "milk," are evidently translations of sound expressions in the
  preface of Pope Sixtus (or Xystus) V., to his edition of the Vulgate. The
  words there are "fel draconum pro vino, pro lacte sanies obtruderetur."
  Wheale more commonly signified, in later times, a pustule or boil; but it
  is from the Ang.-Sax. <i>hwele</i>, putrefaction. The bad taste of such
  language is too manifest to require farther comment.</p>

  <p>If I were disposed to conclude with a Query, I might ask where Q.
  found that <i>wheale</i> ever meant <i>whey</i>?</p>

  <p><i>Arms of the See of York</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 34. 111.

  <i>History of Nottinghamshire</i> (South Muskham, in the east window of
  the chancel), from which it would appear that neither Thoroton himself,
  nor his after-editor Thoresby, could be aware of the change that had
  taken place. The note, however, may help to complete the <i>catena</i> of
  those incumbents of the see of York who (prior to Cardinal Wolsey) bore
  the same arms as the see of Canterbury:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There are the arms of the see of <i>Canterbury</i>, impaling <i>Arg.
  three boars' heads erased and erected sable</i>, Booth, I doubt mistaken
  for the arms of <i>York</i>, as they are with Archbishop Lee's again in
  the same window; and in the hall window at <i>Newstede</i> the see of
  <i>Canterbury</i> impales <i>Savage</i>, who was Archbishop of
  <i>York</i> also, but not of <i>Canterbury</i> that I know
  of."&mdash;Vol. iii. p. 152., ed. Notts, 1796.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can any of your antiquarian contributors say why the sees of
  Canterbury and York bore originally the same arms? Had it any relation to
  the struggle for precedence carried on for so many years between the two
  sees?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Sansom</span>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Waller, in his volume on <i>Monumental Brasses</i>, in describing
  that of William de Grenfeld, Archbishop of York, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The arms of the two archiepiscopal sees were formerly the same, and
  continued to be so till the Reformation, when the pall surmounting a
  crozier was retained by Canterbury, and the cross keys and tiara
  (emblematic of St. Peter, to whom the minster is dedicated), which until
  then had been used only for the church of York, were adopted as the
  armorial bearings of the see."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To the word "tiara" he appends a note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Or rather at this period a regal crown, the tiara having been
  superseded in the reign of Henry VIII."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span></p>

  <p>He gives no authority for the statement, but the note appears
  contradictory, and implies two changes in the first to the cross-keys and
  tiara, which may corroborate the notion of its having been adopted by
  Cardinal Wolsey; secondly, the substitution of the crown for the tiara.
  Can this be proved?</p>

  contains many curious incidental notices of passing events, and of minute

  <p><i>Monumental Inscription in Peterborough Cathedral</i> (Vol. viii.,
  p. 215.).&mdash;In consequence of the very curious Notes communicated by
  <span class="sc">H. Thos. Wake</span>, I would beg to draw that
  gentleman's attention to the very important MS. collections of Bp. White
  Kennet on the subject of this cathedral in the Lansd. MSS., British

  letter, if he will favour me with his address.</p>

  <p><i>Lord North</i> (Vol. vii., p. 207).&mdash;I feel much obliged to
  your correspondent C. for his courtesy in replying to my inquiry
  concerning this nobleman. His remembrance of the personal appearance of
  George III., and his remarks on the subject, are in my opinion
  conclusive; but the appearance of the statement in the <i>Life of
  Goldsmith</i> was such as to provoke inquiry. May I ask our correspondent
  C. (who appears to be acquainted with the North genealogy) whether a
  sister of the premier North, by the some mother, was not alive some years
  after the year 1734? Collins records the birth of an infant daughter, but
  the fact is overlooked in modern peerages.</p>

  <p><i>Land of Green Ginger</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 34. 160. 227.).&mdash;Mr.
  Frost, in his <i>History</i>, p. 71., &amp;c., has shown many instances
  of alteration in the names of streets in Hull from the names of persons,
  as from Aldegate to Scale Lane, from Schayl, a Dutchman; and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Richardson</span> has made it most probable that the
  designation "Land of Green Ginger" took place betwixt 1640 and 1735. It
  has occurred to me, that a family of the Dutch name of Lindegreen (green
  lime-trees) resided at Hull within the last fifty years or more. Now the
  "junior" of this name would be called in Dutch "Lindegroen jonger," which
  may have originated the corruption "Land o' green ginger." This
  conjecture would amount to solution of the question, if the Lindegreens
  had about 150 years ago any property or occupation in this lane. The
  Dutch had necessarily much intercourse with Hull: one of their imports
  was the lamprey, chiefly as bait for turbot, cod, &amp;c. obtained in the
  Ouse near the mouth of the Derwent; which fish was conveyed in boats in
  Ouse Water, and was kept alive and lively by means of poles made to
  revolve in these floating fish-ponds, as I was informed by an alderman
  prior to the reform of that ancient borough. But lamprey has now either
  migrated, or been exterminated by clearing the Ouse of stones<a
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, or by the
  excessive cupidity of the fisherman or gastronomer.</p>

  <p><i>Sheer, and Shear Hulk</i> (Vol. vii., p. 126.)&mdash;A <i>sheer</i>
  hulk is a mere hulk, simply the hull of a vessel unfurnished with masts
  and rigging. A <i>shear</i> hulk, on the contrary, is the hull of a
  vessel fitted with <i>shears</i> (so termed from their resemblance to the
  blades of a pair of shears when opened), for the purpose of masting and
  dismasting other vessels.</p>

  <p>The use of the word <i>buckle</i>, in the signification of bend, is
  exceedingly common both among seamen and builders. For its use among the
  former I can vouch; and among the latter, see the evidence at the
  coroner's inquest on the late melancholy and mysterious accident at the
  Crystal Palace.</p>

  <p><i>Serpent with a Human Head</i> (Vol. iv., p. 191.).&mdash;The
  following passage from Gervasius Tilberiensis (<i>Otia Imperialia</i>,
  lib. i sect. 15.) shows that the idea of the serpent which tempted Eve,
  having a woman's head, was current in the time of Bede. I having not had
  an opportunity of finding whereabouts in Bede's writings the passage
  quoted by Gervasius occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nec erit omittendum, quod ait Beda, loquens de serpente qui Evam
  seduxit: 'Elegit enim diabolus quoddam genus serpentis f&oelig;mineum

  <p><i>"When the maggot bites"</i> (Vol. viii., p 244.).&mdash;An <span
  class="sc">Anon</span> correspondent asks for a note to explain the
  origin of the saying that thing done on the spur of the moment is done
  "when the maggot bites." Perhaps the best explanation is that afforded in
  the following passage from Swift's <i>Discourse on the Mechanical
  Operation of the Spirit</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is the opinion of choice <i>virtuosi</i> that the brain is only a
  crowd of little animals with teeth and claws extremely sharp, and which
  cling together in the contexture we behold, like the picture of Hobbes's
  Leviathan; or like bees in perpendicular swarm on a tree; or like a
  carrion corrupted into vermin, still preserving the shape and figure of
  the mother animal: that all invention is formed by the morsure of two or
  more of these animals upon certain capillary nerves which proceed from
  thence, whereof three branches spring into the tongue and two into the
  right hand. They hold also that these animals are of a constitution
  extremely cold: that their food is the air we attract, their excrement
  phlegm. And that what we vulgarly call rheums, and colds, and
  distillations, is nothing else but an epidemical looseness to which that
  little commonwealth is very subject from the climate it lies under.
  Farther, that nothing less than a violent heat can disentangle these
  creatures from their hamated station in life; or give them vigour and
  humour, to imprint the marks of their little teeth. That if the morsure
  be hexagonal, it produces poetry; the circular gives eloquence. If the
  bite hath been conical, the person whose nerve is so affected shall be
  disposed to write upon politics; and so of the rest."</p>

  <p><i>Definition of a Proverb</i> (Vol. viii., p. 242.).&mdash;The
  proverb, "Wit of one man, the wisdom of many," has been attributed to
  Lord John Russell: I think in a recent number of the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i>. The foundation was laid most probably by Bacon:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It may not be perhaps generally known to your readers, that in a small
  volume, called <i>Origines de la Lengua Espanola, &amp;c., por Don
  Gregorio Mayans y Siscar, Bibliothecario del Rei nuestro Señor</i>, en
  Madrid, Año 1737, will be found a numerous collection of Spanish
  proverbs. A MS. note in my copy has a note, stating that the MS. made for
  Mayans, from the original, in the national library at Madrid, is now in
  the British Museum, Additional MSS., No. 9939.</p>

  some years since offered to have a portrait of him painted for their

  <p><i>"A Tub to the Whale"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 220.).&mdash;In the

  <p>"The learned Mr. Douce has informed a friend of mine, that in
  Sebastian Munster's <i>Cosmography</i> there is a cut of a ship, to which
  a whale was coming too close for her safety; and of the sailors throwing
  a tub <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>{305}</span>to the whale, evidently to play with. The
  practice of throwing a tub or barrel to a large fish, to divert the
  animal from gambols dangerous to a vessel, is also mentioned in an old
  prose translation of the <i>Ship of Fools</i>. These passages
  satisfactorily explain the common phrase of throwing a tub to a
  whale."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir James Macintosh conjectures that the phrase "the tale of a tub"
  (which was familiarly known in Sir Thomas More's time) had reference to
  the tub thrown to the whale.</p>

  <p><i>The Number Nine</i> (Vol. viii., p. 149.).&mdash;The property of
  numbers enunciated and illustrated by <span class="sc">Mr. Lammens</span>
  resolves itself into two.</p>

  <p>1. If from any number above nine be subtracted the number expressed by
  writing the same digits backwards, the remainder is divisible by
  nine.</p>

  <p>2. If the number nine measure a given number, it measures the sum of
  its digits.</p>

  <p>As the latter is proved in most elementary books on Algebra, I confine
  my proof to the former.</p>

  <p>Let the number in question be&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>(<i>a</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> - <i>a</i><sub>0</sub>)(10<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1) + (<i>a</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub> - <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>)(10<sup><i>n</i>-2</sup> - 1) . 10 + ...</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And every term of this difference, as involving a factor of the form
  (1 - 10<sup><i>n</i></sup>), is divisible by 9; and therefore the

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>We have received from Messrs. Williams and Norgate copies of the first
  number of two new German periodicals, with which, when they know their
  nature, some of our readers may desire better acquaintance. Our
  antiquarian friends, for instance, may be glad to know, that the opening
  number of one of these, the <i>Anzeige für Kunde des Deutschen Vorzeit,
  Organ des Germanischen Museums</i> (which is to appear monthly),
  contains, among other articles of antiquarian interest, notes on the
  earliest known MS. of the Nuremburg Chronicle, and on an early MS. of the
  Nibelungen; notice of an original Letter of Pirkheimer, relative to the
  wars of Maximilian against the Swiss; and also of a remarkable, and
  hitherto unknown, old copper-plate engraving on six sheets by an unknown
  artist, apparently of the school of Martin Schon, illustrative of that
  campaign; and an account of an early miscellaneous MS., in which is a
  List of Masons' Marks. The second is one which will interest all lovers
  of folk lore. It is edited by J.&nbsp;W. Wolf, and entitled <i>Zeitschrift für
  Deutsche Mythologie und Sittenkunde</i>, and numbers among its
  contributors, W. Grimm, Nordnagel, Kuhn, and many other good men and
  true, who have devoted their talents to the study of popular antiquities.
  We hope shortly to find room for a specimen or two of the "Old World"
  stories and customs which they have here recorded.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>A Guide containing a
  Short Historical Sketch of Lynton and Places adjacent in North Devon,
  including Ilfracombe</i>, by T.&nbsp;H. Cooper: a well-timed guide to the most
  picturesque portion of one of the most beautiful parts of North Devon,
  pleasantly interlarded with scraps of folk lore and historical
  anecdote.&mdash;In Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>, we have a farther
  issue of Miss Bremer's works, comprising <i>A Diary</i>; <i>The
  H&mdash;&mdash; Family</i>; <i>Axel and Anna</i>, and other Tales: and
  the second volume of Mr. Hickie's translation of <i>The Comedies of
  Aristophanes</i> forms the issue for the present month of the same
  publisher's <i>Classical Library</i>.&mdash;Mr. Darling proceeds with
  great regularity in the publication of his <i>Cyclop&oelig;dia
  Bibliographica</i>, of which we have received No. XII., which extends
  from Bernard Lancy to Martin Madan.&mdash;<i>The Irish Quarterly
  Review</i>, No. XI. for September, contains, among other articles of
  general interest, such as those on <i>French Social Life and Fashion in
  Poetry, and the Poets of Fashion</i>, a farther portion of the amusing
  anecdotical paper, entitled <i>The Streets of Dublin</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">"Bonn, July 19. 1852.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
